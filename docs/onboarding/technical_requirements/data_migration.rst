Data migration
===============

In some cases , it might be necessary to
perform a data migration. A data migration is
necessary if your database is not already
hosted in the environment where it will be
managed by the Rackspace Technology DBA team.
The Rackspace Technology DBA solution does not
include this kind of database migration. You
can however contact Rackspace Technology
customer support for help. Database migrations
will require a separate statement of work and
will be billed separate from the DBA solution.

If you are requesting that the Rackspace Technology
DBA team manage an existing Rackspace database
or requesting remote monitoring of databases
stored elsewhere you will not require any
database migration. In this scenario, you can
skip the data migration and grant the
Rackspace Technology DBA team access to your
environment and then install a monitoring
solution.
