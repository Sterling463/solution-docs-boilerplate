The Rackspace Technology Portal
================================

You will be given access to the Rackspace Technology portal
during the onboarding process. Use the Rackspace Technology
Portal to interact with customer support, as well as create
and view tickets related to your DBA solution. You can also
report any issues or concerns regarding your database through
the Rackspace Technology portal. This places your request in
a queue where it is reviewed by multiple Rackspace Technology personnel.

.. note::

    If you are not familiar with this portal, review
    the customer portal onboarding guide for more information.
