The Rackspace Technology DBA service onboarding process
==========================================================

After you purchase your Rackspace Technology DBA solution,
the Rackspace Technology DBA team begins designing the backend
infrastructure framework necessary to support your environment.
This can take up to 2 weeks.  After this initial set up, an
onboarding steward contacts you to collect details about your
environment and help familiarize you with the Rackspace Technology
customer portal.

The onboarding team also ensures that your database meets the
technical requirements for interfacing with the DBA service.

The onboarding team is responsible for formally transitioning
your database instance to the Database and Customer Success teams.
During the onboarding process, the onboarding team provides you
with a Discovery document that outlines the kinds of information
necessary for a successful engagement.

The Discovery document requires you to provide the following:

- Administrative access for DBAs into your environment
- Contact information for team members you would like notified in the event of an emergency
- Information about your infrastructure

The following are some examples of additional information that you will
need to provide to the onboarding team:

- What are you using the database for?
- What are useful details about how you are using this database?
- Any relevant information about the application and environment.

If you are also an ADT customer, then you will have additional meetings with your
Lead DBA to introduce them to your environment and receive initial.

The following diagram provides an overview of the onboarding process and
migration process for both ADT and PDM customers.
