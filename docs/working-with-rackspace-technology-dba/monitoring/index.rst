Monitoring
===========

The Rackspace DBA team monitors your database
to identify trends and provide data necessary
to predict and plan for the future. Monitoring
allows Rackspace DBAs to review your database
environment and provide insights and expert
feedback. Rackspace DBA monitoring solutions
are available for most database configurations.

Rackspace technology uses the following
monitoring tools to track metrics and events
in your database.

- Microsoft databases hosted with Rackspace Technology
use Microsoft SCOM System Center Operations Manager (SCOM).
- Remote customers and Oracle customers hosted at Rackspace
 will use either Unified Infrastructure Manager (DXIM) or work
  with Rackspace DB Monitoring to develop a custom solution.
- Cloud-Native customers can use either DXIM or any available
 cloud-native monitoring solution.

The DBA team will either fix an issue when it occurs
or notify you of any necessary next steps through
the Rackspace Technology portal.

.. note::

    Typically, customers have a single monitoring solution
    for their entire account but sometimes an environment
    requires multiple solutions.

This chapter provides the following information about the DBA monitoring solution:
