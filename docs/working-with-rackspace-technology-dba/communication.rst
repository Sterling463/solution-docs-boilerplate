Communicating with your DBA team
=================================

A successful DBA solution requires
effective communication with your DBA team.
You are responsible for providing context
about the requirements of your database,
information about the application, and any
predicted important business events
(expected spikes in activity etc).
You should use the Rackspace Technology
customer portal for routine communication
but the following are available options for
communicating with the DBA team, depending
on your solution tier:

- The onboarding team
- Ongoing meetings with Lead DBA

The Onboarding team
--------------------
Provide as much information about your database
to the Onboarding team and your assigned DBA,
if applicable. The Onboarding team will collect
this information about your database to ensure
a successful DBA integration.

Ongoing meetings with Lead DBA
-------------------------------
If you are an Advanced Database Tuning customer,
 you will have regularly scheduled meetings with
 your Lead DBA.

- Weekly or bi-weekly meetings that will address
tactical issues. Any changes to your environment
that may affect your database.
- Monthly strategic meetings about any business changes
that may affect your database needs.
- Quarterly meetings discussing the high-level direction
 of your business and determine if there will be any
 impact to your database.
