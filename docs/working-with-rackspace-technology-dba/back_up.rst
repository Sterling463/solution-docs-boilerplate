===================

Database backups allow you to recover your
data in the event of a system failure.

Rackspace Technology performs database backups for all devices
that are part of the DBA solution. Backups are done using the
native database technology and are customizable to best suit your needs.

Backups can be done in several ways and depends on the location of the server.

- **Local Backups:** The Rackspace DBA team performs local database backups to an attached
local disk. This will speed up the process of restoring a backup if necessary. Local backups
are performed according to an agreed upon schedule.
- **Remote Backups**: You are then responsible for ensuring that your backups are stored on a
secondary form of storage for security purposes.
- **Third Party backups (Commvault):** This an additional service that is not included with the
DBA solution but can be can be purchased to complete the remote backup service.

The Rackspace Technology Managed Backup team completes all backups.
You are notified of any failures or issues with the back-up process
via the Rackspace Technology customer portal.
