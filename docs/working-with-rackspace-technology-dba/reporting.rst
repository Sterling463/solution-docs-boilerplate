Reporting
==========

In addition to standard monitoring,  if you are an ADT customer,
you also receive the following kinds of reporting information
during your regularly scheduled meetings.

- A server review during onboarding meeting. This helps the
Rackspace Technology DBA team work with you decide how to update
your environment according to industry best practices.
- Health checks and proactive monitoring information
- If you are interested in monitoring aspects of your database that
are not already included as a part of the standard DBA engagement, then
the DBA team can also develop custom reports. This is not included as
part of the DBA engagement and would require a separate statement of work.
