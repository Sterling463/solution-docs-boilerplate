Billing
=========

The Rackspace Technology DBA solution is a two-tiered subscription service.
You are billed on a recurring monthly basis for the PDM and ADT solution.

Rackspace Technology begins billing for your DBA subscription once a monitoring
solution has been deployed in your environment. If any additional set up fees
required, then you are billed for those fees after your first engagement with a DBA.
You are invoiced for any Rackspace DBA services during the month in
which services are rendered.

Hourly billing
---------------

In addition to the recurring monthly subscription, Rackspace Technology
bills you on an hourly basis for any work that is beyond the scope of
your original contract. For example, if you subscribe the PDM but
request work that is associated with the ADT tier, then you can be billed at an hourly rate.

Request out of scope work
-------------------------

There are several ways request work that is outside of the scope of your current DBA subscription.

- Open a ticket in the Rackspace customer portal for smaller projects such as adding more
instances or upgrading a database. Other services such as upgrading from DBA to ADT
can also be requested by opening a ticket. Review the Portal onboarding guide for
information about how to create a ticket in the Rackspace customer portal.

The Rackspace Technology DBA team will communicate with you through this ticket.
You will provide any relevant information to understand your request and confirm
that you agree to the charges.

- Contact your Customer service manager to create a Statement of work for larger
projects such as major version upgrades.  You will engage with a solution
architect to define details around fees and invoices.
